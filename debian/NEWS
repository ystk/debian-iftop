iftop (0.17-17) unstable; urgency=low

  The iftop package is now shipped with the "-DNO_SYSTEM" flag enabled.
  This disables the possibility to run commands in a subshell.  This is a
  kind of unexpected feature and could allow users, running iftop via sudo
  to get a complete root shell (if sudo is not configure properly).

  I appologise for any inconvenience caused to users of this feature and
  recommend the usage of screen or several terminal windows.
